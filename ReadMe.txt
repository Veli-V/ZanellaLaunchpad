Zanella Launchpad

I'm studying what's the better license for this project, but I will make it free for everbody :)

Zanella Launchpad is a project that ables you to control Ableton Live with arduino and python.Everything can become a key, or control a synthetizer. The project is made in a way that you can add how many keys you want, and control everything you need in the ableton.
